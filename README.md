The work shows the basic operation of daily work like searching on different tables, classification, and also achieving some complicated requirements like using a subquery. 

Firstly, ensuring that the results are correct is the most important. And the easiest way to check that is to print all items and find out if there is a null value or duplication data. Secondly, for some complicated requirements, what we should do is split the complicated questions into easier questions than before. 

Afterward, we use simple code to solve and achieve the process and get the correct result. Finally, use a subquery to combine the functions together and test to make true it worked and can get the correct answer. In this way, We can highly improve the correct rate, and it is easy to find mistakes. 

Apart from basic operations to process data, we should also think about how to improve performance. For example, when we try to use 'distinct', we should use a smaller table, which means we should organize and filter the data first.
